## Installation

First, install `@x0s3/katachi` in your app:

```bash npm2yarn
yarn add @x0s3/katachi
```

## Install React-Hook-Form

Katachi requires that you install `react-hook-form`. The minimum version of RHF it's been tested on is `6.15.5`.

```bash npm2yarn
yarn add react-hook-form
```

:::tip 
We highly recommend installing as well `@hookform/resolvers`
